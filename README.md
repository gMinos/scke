This project is a simple Python script designed to disable and enable the laptop keyboard on Linux operating systems. 
It utilizes modules such as colorama to print messages on the screen with colors, providing visual feedback to the user about the keyboard status. 
Additionally, it employs argparser to allow the user to pass whether they want to enable or disable the keyboard as a parameter using command-line arguments. 
With the option -e or --enable, the keyboard is enabled, while with the option -d or --disable, it is disabled. 
The script also includes a function to search for the keyboard identifier.
